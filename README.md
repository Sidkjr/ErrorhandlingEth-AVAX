# Error Handling

This solidity program demonstrates the use of revert(), require() and assert() in error handling.
## Description

This program is a simple solidity contract that uses:

- `require()`: Validates a condition, if the condition is true, continues the flow of execution. Else returns a custom string added in its second parameter.
- `revert()`: Reverts back with a string.
- `assert()`: Asserts a condition, reverts back with a Panic of code 0x1: AssertionError.
